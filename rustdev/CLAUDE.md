In this project, we build a rust version of the EloqStore in the ../ directory. In the future, all modifications will be done in this directory, unless strictly necessary. The files in the ../ directory are for read only. 

To make a Rust version, we need to translate the C++ code into equivalent Rust code. You are an expert Rust developer and knows C++ very well. You are also an experienced software architect. You first make a detailed plan by analyzing the C++ code structure, and try to organize the code in a rustean way, as if it was developed natively in Rust, instead of a modification. 

There are places that code must be unsafe. Mark those sections carefully.
